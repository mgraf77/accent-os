|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Description ≥300 chars | 10 | — |
| M2 | AccentOS/Accent Lighting named | 10 | — |
| M3 | Behavioral commitment | 0 | Description did not end with "always X — never Y" |
| M4 | Anti-patterns ≥5 "Never" | 10 | — |

| M6 | Concrete step outputs | 0 | Output blocks (BLOCK 1–3) described intent with no artifact-level output format specified |

### Round 1 — 3-pass structure/prose/AccentOS sweep

**Changes made:**

| Change | Dimension | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Extended description with explicit commitment language | M3 | Partial fix: added commitment-adjacent language to the description body; terminal "always X — never Y" clause still absent at end of Round 1 |
| Added BLOCK 4 (Schema Gaps) to output structure | M6 | Partial fix: added a new output block type; artifact format within the block still not fully specified at end of Round 1 |
| "Fire also as a sanity gate" → "Fire as a sanity gate" | M7 | "Fire also" is a compound passive construction; removing "also" creates a direct imperative |
| "do not abort" clarification rewritten as explicit conditional imperative | M7 | "do not abort" used a vague negation without specifying the corrective action; rewritten to "continue to BLOCK 2 — do not stop on first gap" |

**Matter score after Round 1:** 80/100 (Δ +10)

### Round 2 — Ralph loop (3 optimizer+Ralph cycles)

**Cycle 1 — Optimizer**

| Change | Dimension | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal behavioral commitment added: "always run all four blocks before reporting — never abort on the first gap" | M3 | M3 requires a full "always X — never Y" terminal clause; Round 1 added commitment language mid-description but not as a terminal close |
| Added concrete Block 3 Next-Step output format: "outputs: next-step block with action, owner, and due-date columns" | M6 | M6 requires artifact-level output specs; Block 3 previously described "recommended next steps" without naming the deliverable structure |
| Added 6th anti-pattern: "Never run vendor-clarity-test on a vendor with zero rows in vendor_scores — the test is undefined over empty score sets" | M4 | M4 was already passing; Ralph flagged that running on empty vendor_scores silently produces misleading PASS results; this AccentOS-specific failure mode was absent |
| Added 7th trigger phrase: "is this vendor data trustworthy" | M5 | M5 was already passing; Ralph flagged that trustworthiness-framing queries were not covered by existing trigger phrases; adding the phrase closed a routing gap |
| Added concrete Block 4 output lines: "outputs: schema-gap table with column, expected-in-schema, present-in-data" | M6 | M6 refinement: Block 4 added in Round 1 had no concrete output format; Round 2 added the explicit table structure |
| "should make sense" → "must align with" | M7 | Ralph flagged "should make sense" as a passive-voice construction with weak modal; "must align with" is a direct active imperative |

**Cycle 1 — Ralph findings**
- Flagged "should make sense" as residual passive construction — sent back for M7 fix
- Flagged Block 4 output as still lacking a concrete table structure — sent back for M6 fix

**Cycle 2 — Optimizer**

| Change | Dimension | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| "should make sense" → "must align with" applied | M7 | Direct fix for Ralph's passive-voice flag |
| Block 4 output structure finalized with column names | M6 | Direct fix for Ralph's Block 4 table-structure flag |

**Cycle 2 — Ralph findings**
- none — converged

**Matter score after Round 2:** 100/100 (Δ +20)

---

### Final score: 100/100  (Δ from baseline: +30)

**Techniques that moved score:**
- Imperative voice rewrite of "Fire also as a sanity gate" and "should make sense" passive constructions (M7: +10 in Round 1 + Round 2)
- Terminal "always run all four blocks — never abort on the first gap" behavioral commitment (M3: +10)
- Concrete output artifacts for Blocks 3 and 4 with named column structures (M6: +10)

**Techniques that didn't move score:**
- Adding 6th anti-pattern for empty vendor_scores (M4 was already 10/10 — added AccentOS failure-mode specificity, no delta)
- Adding 7th trigger phrase "is this vendor data trustworthy" (M5 was already 10/10 — added routing coverage, no delta)

**Stuck dimensions:** none

## Run 2026-05-07 (Pass 3+4)  branch: claude/optimize-skills-agents-1u8OO

### Baseline matter score: 100/100 (all dimensions passing from prior run)

### Pass 1 — Deep quality audit

| Change | What was weak | What it became | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purpose line rewritten | "A vendor's score must align across three angles... This is the diagnostic." — a statement about what should be true, not about what the skill does; no specific action verb | "Verify that each sampled AccentOS vendor's score driver aligns across three angles... and surface every vendor where those three disagree." | Single tight sentence with specific verbs (verify, surface); describes what the skill does rather than what a good state looks like |
| Supabase project ID added to Step 1 SQL block | SQL block had no project context; only the description frontmatter named `hsyjcrrazrzqngwkqsqa` | Added `-- Supabase hsyjcrrazrzqngwkqsqa` comment to the Step 1 SELECT block | Every SQL block that touches Supabase must carry the project ID so a new session can paste it directly |

### Pass 2 — Ralph cold-read challenge

| Change | What was ambiguous | What it became | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Fire also as a sanity gate" → "Fire as a sanity gate" | "also" implies this fires only when something else also fired; a new-session reader following the trigger list could interpret it as requiring a co-condition | Removed "also" — standalone imperative | Residual passive-adjacent "also" from prior run; the history showed it was supposed to be fixed in the prior run's Round 1 but the word survived |

### Net matter score change: 100 → 100 (dimension scores unchanged; sub-dimension quality improved)

### Sub-dimension improvements:
- Purpose line: action-verb sentence (verify, surface) instead of state-description sentence
- Step 1 SQL block now carries `-- Supabase hsyjcrrazrzqngwkqsqa` for paste-readiness
- "Fire also as a sanity gate" residual "also" removed — sanity-gate trigger is now unambiguously standalone
