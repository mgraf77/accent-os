# AccentOS KPI Catalog

Last updated: 2026-05-05
Sources mined: 18 (lighting industry, NAW distribution, BigCommerce ecommerce, Scaling Up, Profit First, retail traffic, construction sales, procurement, customer service, workforce, marketing attribution, B2B account management).

This catalog is the source-of-truth for every KPI tracked across AccentOS dashboards. It is consumed by `kpi-data-audit` (gap analysis), `kpi-spec` (per-role SQL generation when forged), `bc-business-review` (weekly digest), and any AccentOS module rendering a dashboard.

⚠ = requires schema addition or external integration before computable.

## Schema naming notes (added 2026-05-05 post-audit)

The catalog uses these short names in formulas; they map to actual tables:

| Catalog short name | Actual Supabase table | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `deals` | `pipeline_deals` | the M02 deals table |
| `inventory` | `inventory_items` | the M22 inventory table |
| `vendors` | `vendors` | exists pre-M01; verify in production |
| `products` | (decision pending) | likely BigCommerce-native via M04, OR Supabase mirror |
| `activity_feed` | `customer_interactions` | M02 |
| `bills` | (not built) | accounting integration pending |
| `expenses` | (not built) | accounting integration pending |

Schema infrastructure already deployed (via M02) that's catalog-relevant:
- `kpi_definitions`, `kpi_snapshots` — KPI tracking is ready; the
  `kpi-snapshot` skill (in future-builds.md) is unblocked.
- `goals` — quota/target tracking infrastructure exists.
- `alerts`, `telemetry_events`, `build_events` — observability exists.
